# Database_Analysis_Breast_Cancer

This report analyzes the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, applying CRISP-DM methodology. It explores, prepares, and models the data using Weka programming, visualizing anomalies and patterns through charts like Histogram and Scatter Plot matrices. Data type conversion enables the use of Decision Trees and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) methods. Standardization and normalization enhance data analysis. The report concludes with the effectiveness of kNN in breast cancer classification and its potential impact on early intervention and treatment.
